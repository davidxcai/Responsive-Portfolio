            <p>Hey there, my name is Dafydd (David). I'm a student web developer trying to create a portfolio website.
                In
                my spare time you can find me playing guitar and recording music. Gaming has been a part of me for as
                far
                as I can remember and it gets me through a lazy Sunday. As inexperienced as I am, I still deeply enjoy
                cooking because it fills me with a sense of accomplishment.</p>

            <p>Currently I work as an occupational therapy assistant (COTA/L). I work with the elderly and help them
                rehabilitate/become independent in their everday lives. I chose to become a software developer because
                I
                enjoy being creative and it seems like the right amount of fun and stress. I tend to lose my train of
                thought and change topics at a whim with no indication. I love corgis and pandas and my current
                favorite
                color is cerulean blue.</p>
